# Guide to Responsible Use

### Student/Researcher:
- Great! Learn from this structure
- Cite properly: "Based on Treaty Bridge Data Module"
- Remember this is a starting point, not an authority

### Developer for another Indigenous community:
- Please adapt this framework for your people
- Share back what you learn
- Build your own cultural protection terms

### Corporation/Institution:
- Pause and reflect
- Contact Mi'kmaw leadership before any use
- Consider how you can give back, not just take

### Mi'kmaw Community Member:
- This is yours to improve, correct, and guide
- The code serves the people, not the other way around

This isn't bureaucracy. It's ceremony for the digital age.
How you use this knowledge becomes part of its story.
