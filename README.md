 Dual License Structure

This repository uses a **dual-license approach**:

### For the CODE (dataclasses, Python structure):
**MIT License** - Free to use, modify, distribute for any purpose.

### For the KNOWLEDGE (Mi'kmaw language, stories, history):
**Mi'kmaw Knowledge License** (below) - Requires respect, relationship, and reciprocity.

This means:
Feel free to adapt the Python framework for your own projects
Study how we structure data with Two-Eyed Seeing
Do not exploit Mi'kmaw cultural knowledge without consent
Do not claim ownership over what belongs to the Mi'kmaw Nation
