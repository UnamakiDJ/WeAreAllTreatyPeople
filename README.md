## 📜 Dual License Structure

This repository uses a **dual-license approach**:

### 1. For the CODE (dataclasses, Python structure):
**MIT License** - Free to use, modify, distribute for any purpose.

### 2. For the KNOWLEDGE (Mi'kmaw language, stories, history):
**Mi'kmaw Knowledge License** (below) - Requires respect, relationship, and reciprocity.

This means:
- ✅ Feel free to adapt the Python framework for your own projects
- ✅ Study how we structure data with Two-Eyed Seeing
- ❌ Do not exploit Mi'kmaw cultural knowledge without consent
- ❌ Do not claim ownership over what belongs to the Mi'kmaw Nation
