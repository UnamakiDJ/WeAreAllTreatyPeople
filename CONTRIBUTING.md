# Contributing to Treaty Bridge Project

## For Mi'kmaw Community Members
Your lived knowledge and language fluency are most valued.
Please:
1. Suggest corrections to language, stories, or history
2. Share how this tool could better serve the community
3. Help identify what should NOT be made public

## For Developers and Researchers
Please:
1. Focus on improving the code structure, not the cultural content
2. Document your changes clearly
3. Respect the dual-license approach (MIT for code, Mi'kmaw terms for knowledge)

## Core Principle
This project serves Mi'kmaw people first.
All contributions should align with that purpose.
